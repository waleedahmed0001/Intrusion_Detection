# Intrusion Detection System


I have detect the intrusion in different requests by using the neural network algorithms. The intrusion is being detected using the multilayer  perceptron model and recurrent neural network(Sequential). You can find all the attached files(model, presentation,dataset,GUI) in the repositry.

# Introduction:
An Intrusion detection system (IDS) is software and/or hardware designed to detect unwanted
attempts at accessing, manipulating, and/or disabling of computer systems, mainly through a
network, such as the Internet. Firewalls limits access between networks to prevent intrusion and
do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS evaluates a suspected intrusion once it has
taken place and signals an alarm. As the network of computers expands both in number of hosts
connected and number of services provided, security has become a key issue for the technology
developers. This work presents a prototype of an intrusion detection system for networks. There
is often the need to update an installed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) due to new attack methods
or upgraded computing environments.


# Project Description:
With the enormous growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of
applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly more important. All
the computer systems suffer from security vulnerabilities which are both technically difficult and
economically costly to be solved by the manufacturers. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is
becoming more important. We studied the details of the research done in anomaly detection and
considered various aspects such as learning and detection approaches, training data sets, testing
data sets, and evaluation methods. 


Dataset is of large size. You can get it from kaggle.


# Conclusion:
I have seen from my project that we can increase the accuracy a more by adding some data in our
dataset of different labels other than normal. Our model has a very huge data on normal label
while on other labels it has very less data. So, for making a good model which can predict almost
all network requests correctly we need to enhance our dataset to make it more accurate and
precise. On the other hand, network intrusion system scope can be increased by scaling it from
detection of requests to block the requests too. We have seen that in many big serversâ€™ network
intrusion detection is used where it not only detects the request as normal or malicious but also
block them and notify the user that the request is malicious and requested. By working on its
dataset and trying different models with different parameters, we can more increase its accuracy
which we will do after this project and try to implement it on real servers.
